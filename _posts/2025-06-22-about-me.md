Hi, I’m Hardee.
I believe some of the most beautiful stories aren’t grand tales from the top of a mountain - but quiet conversations with strangers on a bus, the way sunlight hits a street corner in a new city, or the strange comfort of being lost.

This blog is my journal of those fleeting but vivid moments - from chai stalls in India to evening walks in Europe, from loud laughter to awkward silences. I’ve always been curious about people and places, and this is my way of remembering the small things that made me feel something.

If you like stories that are raw, real, and sometimes a little whimsical, I hope you’ll feel at home here.
Thanks for being here. Let’s share stories.
